Not Your Dad's Dad Jokes
===============

Not Your Dad's Dad Jokes is a web app designed to generate new dad jokes from ICanHazDadJoke's library of dad jokes using a Markov Chain approach.

## Main Features
* Create new dad jokes
* Look into any previous dad jokes that were generated

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing
1. Clone or download the repo

```
clone https://github.com/vangny/not-your-dads-dad-jokes.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

3. Ensure the server is running
```
npm run server-dev
```

4. Make sure the bundle has been compiled. Run the following for the development build:
```
npm run build:dev
```

5. OPTIONAL STEP - run the following for the production build:
```
npm run build:prod
```

6. The webapp should be serverd locally on port 3030. If that port is already being used, you can change the port within the main.js file of the server folder

## Future Additions
* Convert app to a progressive web app
* Possibly isomorphic integration
